        "description": "The last update I didn't like all that much, it changed unwanted settings.I needed time to set the settings to my liking again, took some work but I appreciate that updates are still available.It's necessary and understand,If would write a program I would reconsider the experience of users and take them seriously.Sometimes we know better of experience. More opions, better working programs.I love my phone, please keep it that way. I really don't want to change to Samsung.But as always, improve to give the users the best smartphone experience, gadgets, widgets, which it seems to change, I lost all the sudden the dual clock, important to me as I travel a lot.The weather widget doesn't work no more.If something works good then keep it or you lose some.I hope to get a better version of my phone soon. Either upgrade or getting a new one but either way, I am loyal and stick with Xiaomi as long as it stays in quality and improvement.I believe Xiaomi can outdo Samsung with more finesse, creativity, knowledge and with opening your mind more what people want, like and need!But every phone has good and bad or not so good.That's normal. It depends on the user and person.But I am well satisfied. Best greetings A loyal Xiaomi Phone owner",

Corrupts, destroys and deletes any data moved from internal to external storage without reporting of abstract error. Random app crashes and failures and switching to read-only mode due of file system implementation errors. Camera wastes so much storage by just recording 30 mins of video no matter of encoder used, unable to turn on flashlight during video recording. Stay away from both hell plague.",

It's the fifth day, no reach out or any call from their technician. How difficult and how long does it take for a company like Xiaomi to arrange for a repair appt? Too many faulty TVs ? Most likely not a lasting brand.",

Right after updating the device, colorful lines appeared on the screen. Unfortunately, the store where I bought it told me my warranty had expired after the standard 90-day period.When I reached out to consumer protection authorities (PROCON) here in Brazil, they determined the issue was the manufacturer\u2019s responsibility. I tried contacting Xiaomi's support team by email, but they showed little interest in addressing my problem.I've been a Xiaomi user since the launch of the Mi 4c and have always trusted the brand. However, this experience has left me feeling completely disregarded and mistreated as a loyal customer.",

In accordance with the Law No. 6502 on Consumer Protection and the Regulation on Distance Contracts, we were not allowed to exercise our legal right to return it within 14 days without any justification, using the right of withdrawal.

When i\u00b4m using Android studio, and want to test out my app, I can\u00b4t use a digital phone simulation because i use Windows 11 (which is a Google/Android issue, but whatever) so my only option is to use the only Android I have at home - a Xiaomi. And since I use Windows (the only OS where you need a driver to connect androids to android studio), I go and download the driver from Xiaomi. But no, of course the Xiaomi developer forum looks like a cheap social media platform with a weird URL, I had to make sure that it was no fake website, it wasn\u00b4t, but the problem is that EVERYTHING is in chinese. And you can\u00b4t even change this. Anyways, I try to install the driver, manage to somehow not download a virus off of that cheap website and download it (which surprisingly took very long even though its just a small software), and guess what... It doesnt even freaking work! So, to all devs out there... use windows 10 or MacOS...And definitely not Xiaomi. Yeah. btw my name and pfp is something i made as a 10yo, don\u00b4t judge",

        "description": "Got a Redmi 10 (2022) a couple of months ago and all i can say is that its not a phone. It simply does not function.The price was \"competitive\" though paying a few extra bucks could've gotten me a Motorola that is actually a competent device, and the phone just feels like it was made to swindle me. I was really happy with the phone at first, but then it just progressively got worse to the point that whenever i want to do something i know this phone can't handle, i just feel a sense of dread.For starters, plugging the phone in with a cable literally disables the touchscreen until i close and open the phone multiple times in a row like a maniac. My Bluetooth headphones (Zoopie Neo Plus) just disconnect at random. Running a resource intensive app makes basic system functions (including the keyboard) not function. Everything i do sends an annoying notification that i can't disable because it's \"important\" (yes xiaomi, i need a notification that i turned on battery saver mode. Does this phone think i can't use it?). The phone has several pointless system apps that i can't uninstall. Every app i install has to go through an annoying security check even if i downloaded it from the Play Store.I can excuse the ads in the system apps so they can reduce the price, but making the phone do all of the above and claiming it's \"value\" is downright a scam.This phone is barely a phone, and a lot of my friends agree with me. Xiaomi does not make electronics, i don't know what they are but if they don't work they aren't electronics.",
